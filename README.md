# EC504 Project -- Nearest Neighbor Search
## Rough Timeline:
- March 24 - March 31: implement kd-tree and LSH
- March 31 - April 7: Test both algorithm and compare performance
- **April 9: Midterm Report Due**
- **May 2: Final Presentation**
- **May 4: Final Report Due**
## kd-tree
- Group Members: Zheng Gu, Zhiyu Wang
- Development Language: Java
## Locality Sensistive Hashing
- Group Members: Yutong Gao, Zhiyuan Ruan, Hongtao Zhao
- Development Language: Java
### LSH
- Locality sensitive hashing(LSH): hashing items into bins many times and looking only at those items that fall into the same bin at least once (without looking at every pair). How do we arrange the only high-similarity items are likely to fall into the same bucket.
